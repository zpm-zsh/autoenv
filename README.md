# Autoenv

> Until recently, the default file name used by this plugin was `.env`, but now it is `.in`. This is done in order not to conflict with `.env` files from numerous projects.

#### Autoenv automatically sources (known/whitelisted) `.in` and `.out` files.

This plugin adds support for enter and leave events. By default `.in` files are used when entering a directory, and `.out` files when leaving a directory. And you can set variable `CLICOLOR=1` for enabling colored output.

The environment variables `$AUTOENV_IN_FILE` & `$AUTOENV_OUT_FILE` can be used
to override the default values for the file names of `.in` & `.out` respectively.

## Example of use

- If you are in the directory `/home/user/dir1` and execute `cd /var/www/myproject` this plugin will source the following files if they exist

```
/home/user/dir1/.out
/home/user/.out
/home/.out
/var/.in
/var/www/.in
/var/www/myproject/.in
```

- If you are in the directory `/` and execute `cd /home/user/dir1` this plugin will source the following files if they exist

```
/home/.in
/home/user/.in
/home/user/dir1/.in
```

- If you are in the directory `/home/user/dir1` and execute `cd /` this plugin will source the following files if they exist

```
/home/user/dir1/.out
/home/user/.out
/home/.out
```

## Examples of `.in` and `.out` files

Please, don't use `pwd` or `$PWD`, instead of this use `$(dirname $0)`. Additionally, the path of the directory being entered or exited is passed as the first argument to both `.in` and `.out` scripts, should using a symlink be preferred.

### For node.js developing:

### .in

```sh
nvm use node
OLDPATH=$PATH
export PATH="$(dirname $0)/node_modules/.bin":$PATH
```

### .out

```sh
nvm use system
export PATH=$OLDPATH
```

### For projects with `.env` or/and `.env.local`

```sh
source $(dirname $0)/.env*
```
